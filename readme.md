# ðŸ›’ Shopping List

A small, modern shopping list web app â€” add, update, remove, filter and persist items in your browser.

## What's new / Key features

- Add, edit, remove and clear items.
- Two separate persistent lists in localStorage:
  - `notPurchased` â€” items yet to buy
  - `purchased` â€” items already bought
- Items move between lists when you check/uncheck the item checkbox and the change is saved.
- Speech-to-text input (Web Speech API) with robust feature detection and user-friendly messages.
- Filtering of not-purchased items in real time.

## Browser support / Speech-to-text notes

- Speech recognition uses the Web Speech API:
  - Best supported: Chrome on Android (desktop Chrome also supported).
  - Poor or no support: iOS Safari (no SpeechRecognition), some other mobile browsers.
- If your browser doesn't support the API, the app shows a friendly alert and continues to work without voice input.
- Microphone permission must be granted by the user; some mobile browsers require an explicit user gesture.

_Happy shopping!_
